the input.txt file is specifically formatted to feed the program's arrays in the following order:
the first line of the file is the Allocation array
the second line of the file is the Max array 
the third line of the file is the Available array

each line is only integers separated by a white space. 
each line feeds into the arrays row by row. not column by column.

Compile the cpp file with the command:
$ g++ banker.cpp -o banker

execute the outputted file with the command:
$ ./banker

the proper bankers sequence will output into terminal.
